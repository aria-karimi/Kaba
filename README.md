**Kaba** is a parody programming language inspired by the furious ramblings of a Turkish uncle yelling at a malfunctioning TV. It’s loud, it’s crude, and it’s oddly expressive. Kaba is *not* meant for real-world use; unless your real world involves a lot of yelling and some serious Turkish grammar.

## ⚠️ Fair Warning

Kaba is **NOT** for the easily offended.

This language is full of explicit language, aggressive humor, and culturally specific swearing **on purpose.**

If you’re uncomfortable with vulgarity, profanity, or the idea of a compiler telling you to “siktir,” this project is probably not for you.

We mean no harm; Kaba is a labor of love and laughter. But if you still choose to dive in...
well then, *hoş geldin amk.*

## 🧠 Sample Code

```kaba
Düz Bok’tan bokbir çök amk
bokbir’e binbir’i sok amk

bokbir sıfır’la aynı siktiyse hadi
    bokbir’e bir’i sok amk
siktir sikmediyse hadi
    bokbir’e sıfır’ı sok amk
siktir
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

This repo is still under development. For now, check out [`Kaba.pdf`](./docs/Kaba.pdf) for full language specs and examples.

## 🤬 What the hell is this?

Kaba is a strongly-typed, case-sensitive, Turkish-syntax-based language where:

- **Keywords are insults**
- **Suffixes follow Turkish vowel harmony**
- **Numbers are forbidden in digit form**
- **Statements end in profanity**

You’ll love it. Or hate it. Either way, it’ll yell back.

## 📜 Syntax Highlights

- **Primitive Types**: `Düz`, `Sulu`, `Net`, `Saçma`  
- **Arrays**: Add `Torbası` after a type (e.g. `Düz Bok Torbası`)
- **Operators**: `kat`, `sök`, `çak`, `yar`, `aynı`, `koymuş`, `koymamış`, `tersi`, `ve`, `ya`
- **Conditionals**: `siktiyse`, `sikmediyse`
- **Loops**: `sikerken`, `sallayarak`
- **Functions**: Use `kus` to return and surround bodies with `hadi`...`siktir`
- **Classes**: Yep. Object-oriented obscenity.

## 📦 Features

- **Blasphemous keywords**

- **Turkish suffix logic**

- **Strong typing**

- **Exception handling with denesene / sıçarsa / patlat**

- **Basic OOP support**

## 🛠️ Roadmap

 - **Implement a compiler**

 - **Add built-in functions**

 - **Create a VS Code syntax highlighter**

 - **Build a language server**

 ## 🤡 Why?

Because programming is already a cursed activity. Kaba just says the quiet parts out loud.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is satire. Don’t use Kaba in production. Or do. We won’t stop you. But your coworkers will.
